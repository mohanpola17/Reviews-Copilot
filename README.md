## How I Deployed

### Backend (Render)
1. Connected GitHub repo to Render
2. Set environment variables in Render dashboard:
   - `API_KEY`: Generated secure key
   - `DATABASE_URL`: `sqlite:///./reviews.db`
   - `AI_ENABLED`: `true`
3. Render automatically detected Python and ran `uvicorn main:app`

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. Connected GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `build`
4. Added environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Backend Render URL
   - `REACT_APP_API_KEY`: Same as backend

## Time Spent & Trade-offs

### Time Breakdown (7 hours total)
- **Backend API development**: 2.5 hours
- **Database setup and models**: 1 hour
- **AI integration (Hugging Face)**: 1.5 hours
- **Frontend React components**: 2 hours
- **Testing and debugging**: 1 hour

### Key Trade-offs Made

1. **SQLite vs PostgreSQL**
   - **Chose:** SQLite for simplicity
   - **Why:** Faster setup, no external dependencies, assignment said "keep it simple"
   - **Trade-off:** Less concurrent users, but fine for this use case

2. **Hugging Face vs OpenAI**
   - **Chose:** Hugging Face local models
   - **Why:** No API costs, works offline, assignment gives +1 bonus for Hugging Face
   - **Trade-off:** Slower initial load, but more reliable

3. **React vs Streamlit**
   - **Chose:** React for better UX
   - **Why:** More professional look, better for interviews
   - **Trade-off:** More complex setup, but worth it

4. **Simple vs Complex AI**
   - **Chose:** Template-based replies with AI analysis
   - **Why:** More reliable than pure LLM generation
   - **Trade-off:** Less creative, but more consistent

5. **Local vs Cloud Database**
   - **Chose:** Local SQLite file
   - **Why:** Simpler deployment, no external services
   - **Trade-off:** Not scalable, but perfect for demo

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /ingest` - Upload reviews
- `GET /reviews` - List reviews with filters
- `GET /reviews/{id}` - Get single review
- `POST /reviews/{id}/suggest-reply` - Generate AI reply
- `GET /analytics` - Get analytics data
- `GET /search?q=query` - Search similar reviews

All endpoints require: `Authorization: Bearer demo-key-123`

## Sample Data

The app comes with 8 sample reviews covering different scenarios:
- Positive/negative/neutral sentiments
- Different locations (Downtown, Mall, Airport)
- Various topics (service, food, atmosphere)
- Pre-analyzed with AI for demo purposes

## What I Learned

- **Hugging Face Transformers** are powerful for local AI without API costs
- **TF-IDF + cosine similarity** works great for text search
- **FastAPI** makes building APIs really fast and clean
- **React with TypeScript** catches errors early and improves development experience
- **SQLite with WAL mode** handles concurrent access surprisingly well
- **Template-based AI replies** are more reliable than pure LLM generation
- **Connection pooling** is crucial for database performance

## Future Improvements

If I had more time:
- Add user authentication and multi-tenant support
- Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
- Add more sophisticated AI reply generation
- Include export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- Add mobile responsiveness improvements
- Implement caching for better performance

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- CORS errors: Check backend CORS settings
- AI models not loading: Ensure enough RAM (2GB+ recommended)
- Database locked: Stop all processes and restart
- Build fails: Delete node_modules and reinstall

**Debug mode:**
```bash
# Backend
DEBUG=1 uvicorn main:app --reload

# Frontend  
REACT_APP_DEBUG=true npm start
```
